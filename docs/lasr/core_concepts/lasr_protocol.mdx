LASR Protocol can be expressed in JSON files, which use JSON-RPC (Remote Procedure Call) methods. LASR's JSON RPC API allows developers to interact and test LASR programs directly, with data structures represented as JSON. This approach enables developers to send information to a LASR cluster and receive responses from the network in a structured format that is easy to parse and work with.

## Protocol Structure

Each field in the LASR protocol plays a crucial role in defining the transaction's operation, the involved parties, the transaction's value, and the account's state. The structure and purpose of each field are closely tied to the blockchain's operation and security mechanisms, ensuring transactions are authentic, secure, and correctly processed. The following table describes the essential parameters you will find when working with the LASR Protocol.

| Parameter                        | Description                                                                                                       |

:::info
  When testing your program, you can create JSON files to simulate a call from the LASR network and ensure your program is behaving as expected, as described in the page [Creating Your First Program](/getting_started/creating_your_first_program#step-4-test-your-program).
