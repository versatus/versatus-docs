When you start a new project with Laser, selecting the appropriate template is essential to ensure your project aligns with your goals and the capabilities of the Laser network. Currently, Versatus provides four templates you can use to start your project:

- [Hello LASR](#hello-lasr)
- [Blank](#blank-template)
- [Fungible](#fungible-template)
- [Non-Fungible](#non-fungible-template)
- [Faucet](#faucet-template)

In the following sections, you find descriptions for each template and tips on when to use each one.

## Hello LASR

The Hello LASR template is a example project to help you deploy your first program in LASR. This template goal is to guide you through the essential parts of any program you may want to deploy on LASR. You can find this tutorial at our [Getting Started](/lasr/getting_started/creating_your_first_program) guides.

## Blank Template

The blank template is the starting point for any new project. It provides the minimal code necessary to submit and listen to transactions on the LASR network. This template is ideal for developers who want to build from scratch or integrate specific functionalities into their projects. Versatus recommends you to use the blank template to:

- Starting a new project from scratch.
- Integrating custom functionalities into your project.

## Fungible Template

The fungible template is designed for projects that require the creation of fungible tokens. Fungible tokens are divisible and can be subdivided into smaller units. This means that if you have 100 tokens, you can send 2.2 tokens to someone else, and they can send you back 1.5 tokens. You can use this template for projects that require a currency or any token that can be split up and sent back and forth. Versatus recommends you to use the fungible template to:

-  Creating a project that requires a currency or token that can be subdivided.
-  Implementing a system where tokens can be exchanged in parts.

## Non-Fungible Template

The non-fungible template is tailored for projects that require non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens cannot be split up. Each token is unique and represents a distinct item or asset. This template is crucial for projects that involve unique items or assets, such as digital art, collectibles, or any item that cannot be subdivided. Versatus recommends you to use the non-fungible template to:

-  Creating a project that involves unique items or assets.
-  Implementing a system where tokens represent distinct items or assets.

## Faucet Template

The faucet template is a specialized tool for creating new tokens in the network. By utilizing the faucet template, developers can build and deploy a faucet program, then add fungible tokens to it. Once set up, users can interact with the faucet to receive the available fungible tokens. Versatus recommends you to use the faucet template to:

-  Testing your project in a test network.
-  Developing and testing smart contracts without the need for real tokens.
