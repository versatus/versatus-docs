Versatus is the Universal Decentralized Application (dApp) Engine that allows all developers to truly build without barriers.

Today building smart contracts and decentralized applications in Web3 can seem complicated, exclusive, and exhaustive as a developer. That's because currently, it is. But it doesn't have to be that way, and it definitely won't stay that way with Versatus.

## Why Build on Versatus

## Flexibility

Developers can build smart contracts in familiar programming languages such as Rust, JavaScript, Go, C++, Python, C, and more. Eliminating the barriers to entry in blockchain development invites a wider pool of talent and doing so breeds familiarity efficiency and creativity, leading to more quality and diverse applications.

## Cross-Chain Settlement

In a blockchain ecosystem that is becoming increasingly fragmented, the ability to interact across different chains is invaluable. Versatus provides the necessary infrastructure for their developers to integrate contracts on their blockchain networks and communities of choice.

## Scalability

By allowing off-chain execution of smart contracts, Versatus developers benefit from reduced operational costs, improved scalability, and overall enhanced dApp performance and user experience.


Unlike other projects, Versatus won't pigeonhole you into a certain or limited range of languages or a single chain. There is no Web3 prerequisite or steep learning curve. Rather than struggling with new languages and tools, developers can focus on innovating their dApps.
