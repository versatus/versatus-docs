Versatus LASR requires Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to function properly on Windows OS. Follow this guide to install WSL and set it up for use with LASR.

## Step 1: Install WSL

You can either install WSL on windows through command line in PowerShell, or Windows Store:

  <TabItem label="Command Line" value="Command Line">
  The following process will enable the necessary WSL components and install the default Linux distribution (Ubuntu):

  1. Open PowerShell as Administrator. You can do this by searching for "PowerShell" in the Start menu, right-clicking it, and selecting "Run as administrator".
  2. In the PowerShell window, enter the following command and press Enter:

```powershell
wsl --install
```
After running the command above, you will need to restart your computer. Make sure to save your work and then restart your machine.

## Step 3: Update Ubuntu

1. Once you have set up Ubuntu, it's important to update it. Open the Ubuntu terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 4: Install Node.js and npm

Now, with your Ubuntu updated, you need to install Node V18 or newer, as [required by Versatus LASR](/lasr/creating_your_first_program#prerequisites). Run the following comands to install the required packages:

```sh
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
```
Remember to check if your node version is higher than 18. To see what version you currently have installed, run:

```sh
node -v
```

## Creating your First Program with LASR

With all steps completed, you are ready to continue your journey. Start by creating a Hello LASR program by following the [Creating your First Program](/lasr/creating_your_first_program#hello-lasr) guide.
