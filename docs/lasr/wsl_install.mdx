Versatus LASR requires Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to function properly on Windows OS. Follow this guide to install WSL and set it up for use with LASR.

## Step 1: Install WSL

You can either install WSL on windows through command line in PowerShell, or Windows Store:

  Installing WSL via Windows Store requires the following steps:

  2. Click **Download**. The WSL with the Ubuntu OS will be installed into your machine.

  <TabItem label="Command Line" value="Command Line">
  Follow the steps below to enable WSL components and install the default Linux distribution (Ubuntu):

  1. Open PowerShell as Administrator. You can do this by searching for **PowerShell** in the Start menu, right-clicking it, and selecting **Run as administrator**.
  2. In the PowerShell window, enter the following command and press **Enter**:

```powershell
wsl --install
```
After running the command above, you'll need to restart your computer. Before restarting your computer, be sure to save your work.

## Step 2: Verify the Installation

To verify if your WSL is correctly installed, do the following:

1. Open PowerShell.
2. Execute the command below:

```sh
wsl --list --verbose
```

This will present a list of installed distributions, with Ubuntu listed and running.


## Step 3: Set Up Ubuntu

With your Ubuntu installed:

1. Open your Ubuntu distribution from the Start menu.
2. You'll be prompted to create a user account and password for Ubuntu. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

## Step 4: Update Ubuntu

1. Once you have set up Ubuntu, it's important to update it. Open the Ubuntu terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 5: Install Node.js and npm

Now, with your Ubuntu updated, you need to install Node V18 or newer, as [required by Versatus LASR](/lasr/creating_your_first_program#prerequisites). Run the following comands to install the required packages:

```sh
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
```
Remember to check if your node version is higher than 18. To see what version you currently have installed, run:

```sh
node -v
```

Your terminal will return something similar to the following:

```bash
you@laptop:~/versatus$ node -v
v20.12.2
```

:::warning
If the version is lower than 18, you need to update Node.
