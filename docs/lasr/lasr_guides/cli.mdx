The LASR CLI enables you to interact with your deployed program on the LASR network. 

## Interact with Your Deployed Program via CLI

Versatus provides the CLI so you can execute commands and transactions that showcase the capabilities of your program. The CLI offers a straightforward method to test and validate that your program operates as intended within the LASR network environment.

To start interacting with your deployed program via the CLI, use the following command structure:

```bash
npx lasrctl call [params]
```

The `npx lasrctl` command supports various options to tailor your interaction with the program. The following table lists the available options and describes the expected response. Notice that some of the options are required to use the CLI.


| Option            | Description                                       | Type    | Required |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| `--version`       | Displays the version number of the program.                              | boolean | No       |
| `--help`          | Displays the help message.                                         | boolean | No       |
| `--programAddress`| Specifies the address to which data will be sent.                       | string  | Yes      |
| `--op`            | Specifies the operation to be performed.          | string  | Yes      |
| `--inputs`        | Specify a JSON file containing any custom parameters that are optional or required by your program.                     | string  | Yes      |
| `--keypairPath`   | Specifies the path to the keypair file.                        | string  | No       |
| `--secretKey`     | Specifies the secret key for wallet access.                   | string  | No       |

The code block below presents an example of how you can use the CLI. In this case, the CLI is interacting with a LASR version of the traditional Hello World example. In the example, the user is trying to use the `hello` operationg, providing the `name` parameter, which, in the example below was defined as `Joe`.

```bash
npx lasrctl call --programAddress <YOUR_PROGRAM_ADDRESS_FROM_DEPLOY> --op hello --inputs '{"name": "Joe"}'
```

The result of running the above command is presented next. You can test this example. 

```bash
Hello Joe
```
