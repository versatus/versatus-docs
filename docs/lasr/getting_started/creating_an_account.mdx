# Creating an Account

To use the Versatus LASR, you need to have an account to deploy your application and run it in the LASR network. To create and use LASR, you need to complete the following steps:

<Steps>
### Download the LASR Wallet

LASR Wallet is a browser extension. Below, you will find the complete list of browsers that support it.

| Windows |   Mac   |  Linux |
|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
| Chrome  | Chrome  | Chrome |
| Brave   | Brave   |        |
| Edge    | Edge    |        |
|         | Arc     |        |
|         | Vivaldi |        |

Access [LASR Wallet](https://itero.plasmo.com/ext/omkbidglggpedccmhohmemehpghgidaj) to check the necessary steps to add the wallet to your browser.

### Get Credits

To get started with LASR, Versatus provides free test credits for new users. This allows you to create and test your applications without any financial commitment. To receive these credits, join the [Versatus Discord community](https://discord.gg/2MaKFR35VJ) and request them.

:::info
  A boot will soon be available to handle the funds' requests in the Discord community.

### Connect Your Wallet

The final step is to connect your wallet to [LASR Faucet](http://faucet.versatus.io/). You must have completed Step 1 before. When you finish connecting your wallet to LASR Faucet, you will have an account that will enable you to use LASR.

When you connect your wallet to the Faucet, a new **Secret Key** is generated. You'll use it to have access to the LASR network.

</Steps>

You need to complete the steps above to proceed once credits are necessary to cover the deployment costs. Versatus uses this approach to minimize spamming. Currently, LASR Faucet is the only source of funds that enables you to register your program on the network.

:::info
  The LASR TestNet allows program registration without any fees. The blockchain networks of TestNet offer a less risky environment for users to submit their programs or to test them. As blockchains require a live public network for testing purposes, TestNet provides a suitable testing environment.
