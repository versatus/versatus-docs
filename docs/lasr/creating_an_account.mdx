To use Versatus LASR, you need to have an account to deploy your application and run it in the LASR network. To do so, you need to complete the following steps:

## Step 1: Download the LASR Wallet

LASR Wallet is a browser extension. Below, you will find the complete list of browsers that support it.

| Windows |  Mac  | Linux |
|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
| Chrome | Chrome | Chrome |
| Brave  | Brave  |    |
| Edge  | Edge  |    |
|     | Arc   |    |
|     | Vivaldi |    |

Access [LASR Wallet](https://itero.plasmo.com/ext/omkbidglggpedccmhohmemehpghgidaj) to check the necessary steps to add the wallet to your browser.

## Step 2: Get VERSE

Versatus provides free test VERSE tokens for new users to start with LASR. The free tokens allow you to create and test your applications without financial commitment. To receive these credits, join the Versatus Discord community and request them.

:::info â€‹Why You Need VERSE Tokens
VERSE is the native token of the Versatus LASR ecosystem. It's used to cover deployment costs and other transactions within the network. By providing free test VERSE tokens, Versatus lowers the barrier for new developers to experiment and build on the platform without financial risks.

A bot is available in the [Versatus Discord community](https://discord.gg/2MaKFR35VJ) to handle funds requests.

## Step 3: Connect Your Wallet

The final step is to connect your wallet to [LASR Playground](http://faucet.versatus.io/). You must have completed Step 1 before. When you connect your wallet to LASR Playground, you will have an account enabling you to use LASR.

When you connect to the LASR Wallet extension, a new **Secret Key** is generated. You'll use it to have access to the LASR network.

You have to complete the steps above to proceed once credits are necessary to cover the deployment costs. Versatus uses this approach to minimize spamming. Currently, LASR Faucet is the only source of funds that enables you to register your program on the network.

:::info
The LASR Testnet/Devnet allows program registration without any fees. The blockchain networks of Testnet/Devnet offer a less risky environment for users to submit their programs or to test them. As blockchains require a live public network for testing purposes, Testnet/Devnet provides a suitable testing environment.
