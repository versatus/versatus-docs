LASR Chess program is composed of some core functions that define how it works. This page explores all these functionalities LASR Chess has to offer, presenting you details about each method available in the `lasr-chess.ts` file found in the [cloned project](/lasr/tutorials/chess/deploy).

## Creating a Program

When you create a new program using LASR, you need to create a class that extends the `Program` class from @versatus/versatus-javascript, incorporating your specific methods. Below, you find all methods used within LASR Chess: 

<LinkCards numColumns={3} data={[
  { title: 'Create', linkTo: '#create' },
  { title: 'Register User', linkTo: '#register-user' },
  { title: 'New Game', linkTo: '#new-game' },
  { title: 'Accept Game', linkTo: '#accept-game' },
  { title: 'Make Move', linkTo: '#make-move' },
]}/>

:::note
All LASR Chess methods leverage different functions from @versatus/versatus-javascript. Refer to the [Methods Reference table](#methods-reference) for more information on each one.

### Create

The `create` method is required in every program created with LASR, as it's executed during deployment. The `create` method utilizes parameters specified in the [`lasrctl deploy`](/lasr/tutorials/chess/deploy#step-4-deploy-lasr-chess) command to set up the program. For LASR Chess, this method creates an NFT.

The `create` method uses parameters provided in the `lasrctl deploy` command to establish the program's initial conditions and settings. This method sets up the program's metadata and data, and initiates any necessary initial distributions or configurations.

:::info
It's important to note that `metadata` in line 5 are the parameters required to create a program with LASR.

Below you find the code block exemplifying the method in LASR Chess followed by a breakdown of the steps taken by the method:

<CodeWrapper height="290px">
```ts showLineNumbers filename="create"
create(computeInputs: IComputeInputs) {
    try {
      const { transaction } = computeInputs;
      const { from, to } = transaction;
      const metadata = parseMetadata(computeInputs);
      const { initializedSupply, totalSupply, symbol, name } = metadata;
      const imgUrl =

          methods,
        },
      });
      const distributionInstruction = buildTokenDistribution({

        initializedSupply,
        currentSupply: "0",
        to: THIS,
        nonFungible: true,
      });
      const createAndDistributeInstruction = buildCreateInstruction({
        from,
        initializedSupply,
        totalSupply,
        programId: THIS,
        programOwner: from,
        programNamespace: THIS,
        distributionInstruction,
      });
      return new Outputs(computeInputs, [
        createAndDistributeInstruction,
        updateData,

| Step                               | Lines       | Description                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transaction and Input Parsing**          | `3-4`         | It begins by parsing the transaction details and the inputs provided during the deployment command.                                    |
| **Metadata Handling**                      | `5-6`        | Parses and validates metadata associated with the program (like supply details, symbol, and name), which are crucial for the setup.                     |
| **Data Setup**                             | `7-9`       | Constructs the initial data structure for the program, including image URLs, and available methods.                                      |
| **Update Metadata and Data**            | `10-27` | Updates the program metadata and data fields using the program's namespace and addresses.                                                |
| **Distribution and Creation Instructions** | `28-43`   | Handles the initial token distribution based on the initialized and current supply and creates the initial setup instructions for the program. For LASR Chess, it distributes the initialized supply to the program itself. |
| **Output Generation**                      | `44-48`       | Outputs are generated and returned in JSON format, which includes all the instructions for creating and updating the program.           |


### Register User

The `registerUser` method enables the addition of new users to LASR Chess, storing their information within the program's NFT. This NFT accumulates data from all users and the program itself. The `registerUser` method also modifies the user's NFT, adding the connection to the program through one `tokenId` available in the main program. Below you find the code block exemplifying the method in LASR Chess followed by a breakdown of the steps taken by the method:

<CodeWrapper height="290px">
```ts showLineNumbers filename="registerUser"
registerUser(computeInputs: IComputeInputs) {
  try {
    const txInputs = parseTxInputs(computeInputs);
    const { programId } = computeInputs.transaction;
    const { username, address } = txInputs;
    validate(username, "missing username");
    const programAccountData = parseProgramAccountData(computeInputs);
    const currUsers = JSON.parse(programAccountData?.users);
    validate(currUsers, "unable to parse users");
    const addUserToChessMainProgram = updateProgramData({
      programAddress: THIS,
      data: {
        users: validateAndCreateJsonString({
          ...currUsers,
          [address]: username,
        }),
      },
    });
    const tokenIds = parseAvailableTokenIds(computeInputs);
    const transferInstruction = buildTransferInstruction({
      from: programId,
      to: address,
      tokenAddress: programId,
      tokenIds: [tokenIds[0]],
    });
    return new Outputs(computeInputs, [
      addUserToChessMainProgram,
      transferInstruction,
    ]).toJson();
  } catch (e) {
    throw e;
  }
}
```
</CodeWrapper>

| Step                               | Lines       | Description                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transaction and Input Parsing**          | `3-4`         | It begins by parsing the transaction details and the inputs provided during the deployment command.                                    |
| **User Validation**                      | `5-6`        | Validates the presence of the username provided in the inputs.                     |
| **Program Account Data Parsing**                             | `7-8`       | Parses the program account data to get the current list of users.                                     |
| **User Data Validation**            | `9` | Validates the parsed users data to ensure it is correctly formatted and not null.                                               |
| **Update Program Data** | `10-18`   | Updates the program data to include the new user, constructing a JSON string with the updated user list. |
| **Token Transfer Instruction**                      | `19-25`       | Handles the transfer of a token from the program to the new user, using the first available token ID.           |
| **Output Generation**                      | `26-29`       | Outputs are generated and returned in JSON format, which includes the instructions for adding the user and transferring the token.           |

### New Game

The `newGame` method creates a new game by updating the user's NFT, adding the new game information to it, starting the match with a new "[FEN](https://www.chess.com/terms/fen-chess#:~:text=FEN%20is%20the%20abbreviation%20of,by%20the%20journalist%20David%20Forsyth.)", the user's address, the wager, and a game state of initialized. Below you find the code block exemplifying the method in LASR Chess followed by a breakdown of the steps taken by the method:

<CodeWrapper height="290px">
```ts showLineNumbers filename="newGame"
newGame(computeInputs: IComputeInputs) {
  try {
    const { from } = computeInputs.transaction;
    const txInputs = parseTxInputs(computeInputs);
    const { wager } = txInputs;
    const gameId = generateGameId();
    const updateProgramDataInstruction = updateTokenData({
      accountAddress: from,
      programAddress: THIS,
      data: {
        [`game-${gameId}-fen`]: NEW_GAME_FEN,
        [`game-${gameId}-address1`]: from,
        [`game-${gameId}-gameState`]: "initialized",
        [`game-${gameId}-wager`]: wager,
      },
    });
    const amountNeededForWager = parseAmountToBigInt(wager ?? "0");
    const transferToProgram = buildTransferInstruction({
      from: from,
      to: THIS,
      tokenAddress: VERSE_PROGRAM_ADDRESS,
      amount: amountNeededForWager,
    });
    return new Outputs(computeInputs, [

      transferToProgram,
    ]).toJson();
  } catch (e) {
    throw e;
  }
}
```
</CodeWrapper>

|------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transaction Parsing**          | `3-4`         | It begins by parsing the transaction details from the inputs provided during the command.                                    |
| **Input Parsing**                      | `5`        | Parses additional inputs, including the wager for the new game.                     |
| **Game ID Generation**                             | `6`       | Generates a unique game ID for the new game using an auxiliary function.                                     |
| **Update Program Data Instruction**            | `7-16` | Constructs the data to update the program, including the game state, player address, and wager, then creates the instruction to update the token data with this information.                                               |
| **Wager Parsing and Transfer Instruction** | `17-23`   | Parses the wager amount to a big integer and constructs the instruction to transfer the wager amount from the player to the program. |

### Accept Game

The `acceptGame` method will add a second player to a previously created game, and change its state to in progress. This is the process of adding a second player to the match. Below you find the code block exemplifying the method in LASR Chess followed by a breakdown of the steps taken by the method:

<CodeWrapper height="290px">
```ts showLineNumbers filename="acceptGame"
acceptGame(computeInputs: IComputeInputs) {
  try {
    const { from } = computeInputs.transaction;
    const txInputs = parseTxInputs(computeInputs);
    const { gameId, address1, wager } = txInputs;
    const updateGameStateInstruction = updateTokenData({
      accountAddress: address1,
      programAddress: THIS,
      data: {
        [`game-${gameId}-gameState`]: "inProgress",
        [`game-${gameId}-address2`]: from,
      },
    });
    const amountNeededForWager = parseAmountToBigInt(wager ?? "0");
    const transferToProgram = buildTransferInstruction({
      from: from,
      to: "this", // Represents the program's address.
      tokenAddress: VERSE_PROGRAM_ADDRESS,
      amount: amountNeededForWager,
    });
    return new Outputs(computeInputs, [
      updateGameStateInstruction,
      transferToProgram,
    ]).toJson();
  } catch (e) {
    throw e;
  }
}
```
</CodeWrapper>

| Step                               | Lines       | Description                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Make Move

Everytime a player makes a move, being it the first or second player, the `makeMove` method is called. This method will leverage the [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md) library, using the FEN received to execute a move. After, it will take different actions based on the state of the game. If it is over, it will transfer the wager to the winner. if not, it will keep the game in progress until it finishes. Below you find the code block exemplifying the method in LASR Chess followed by a breakdown of the steps taken by the method:

<CodeWrapper height="290px">
```ts showLineNumbers filename="makeMove"
makeMove(computeInputs: IComputeInputs) {
  try {
    const { from } = computeInputs.transaction;
    const { move, fen, address1, gameId, wager } = parseTxInputs(computeInputs);
    validate(move, "missing move");
    validate(gameId, "missing gameId");
    validate(fen, "missing fen");
    const chess = new Chess(fen);
    chess.move(move);
    const instructions = [];

    if (chess.isGameOver()) {
      const payoutAmount = parseAmountToBigInt(wager ?? "0") * BigInt(2);
      const transferPayoutToWinner = buildTransferInstruction({
        from: THIS,
        to: from,
        tokenAddress: VERSE_PROGRAM_ADDRESS,
        amount: payoutAmount,
      });

          programAddress: THIS,
          data: {
            [`game-${gameId}-fen`]: chess.fen(),
            [`game-${gameId}-winnerAddress`]: from,
            [`game-${gameId}-gameState`]: "finished",
          },
        }),
        transferPayoutToWinner,
      );
    } else {
      instructions.push(
        updateTokenData({
          accountAddress: address1,
          programAddress: THIS,
          data: {
            [`game-${gameId}-fen`]: chess.fen(),
            [`game-${gameId}-gameState`]: "inProgress",
          },
        }),
      );

| **Game Over Check and Instructions**            | `12-43` | Checks if the game is over. If it is, constructs instructions to update the game state to "finished", set the winner's address, and transfer the payout to the winner. If not, constructs instructions to update the game state to "inProgress" with the new FEN.                                               |
| **Output Generation**                      | `45`       | Outputs are generated and returned in JSON format, which includes the instructions for updating the game state and transferring the payout if the game is over.           |


## Methods Reference
