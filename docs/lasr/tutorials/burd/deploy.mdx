This guide outlines the necessary steps to deploy your BURD version. All the required steps are described below.

<Steps>
### Clone the BURD Repository

Begin by cloning the BURD project from the [@versatus/versatus-burd](https://github.com/versatus/versatus-burd) GitHub repository to your local machine:

```sh copy
git clone git@github.com:versatus/versatus-burd.git
```

### Building the Project

Since BURD is already an initialized project, you only need to install and build it. Execute the following commands:

```sh copy
cd lasr \
&& npm install
```

:::info
There is no need to initialize the project using `lasrctl init` as the BURD project is pre-configured.
:::

With the project installed, you need to build the program. Execute the commands below:

```sh copy
npx lasrctl build burd.ts
```

### Test your Program

Before trying to use the program, you should test it. It'll ensure the program functions correctly before deployment. Use this command to run the tests:

```sh copy
npx lasrctl test -b burd -i burd-inputs
```

All BURD functions will be tested to ensure you won't face problems while trying the program. The output should look something like this:

```sh copy
...

All tests completed. Summary of results:
Test 1 (burd-add-user.json): Passed
Test 2 (burd-approve.json): Passed
Test 3 (burd-churp.json): Passed
Test 4 (burd-create-fail.json): Passed
Test 5 (burd-create.json): Passed
Test 6 (burd-delete-churp.json): Passed
Test 7 (burd-follow.json): Passed
Test 8 (burd-like.json): Passed
Test 9 (burd-unlike.json): Passed
Test 10 (burd-update.json): Passed
```

### Deploy BURD

Once all tests have passed, you are ready to deploy BURD. Use the following command, which includes all necessary parameters for a successful deployment:

```sh copy
npx lasrctl deploy --build burd --programName BURD --symbol BURD --initializedSupply 100 --totalSupply 100 \
 --txInputs '{"imgUrl":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKuNIgAa4AALDce?format=jpg&name=medium","collection":"burd"}'
```

:::warning
 Deployments may occasionally fail on the first attempt. If this occurs, simply rerun the `deploy` command. It often succeeds on the second try.
:::

:::info
 See the [CLI](/lasr/lasr_guides/cli) or [Deploy Configuration](/lasr/lasr_guides/deploy_configuration) for additional information about the deploy.
:::

After a successful deployment, the command line will provide a `program address`. Make sure to save this address, as you will need it to run the frontend later.

</Steps>

### What's Next?

With a successfully deployed BURD program, you now can learn more about how the program was created, or go check out how to spin up the frontend to interact with BURD:
