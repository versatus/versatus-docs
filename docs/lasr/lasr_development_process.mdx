Versatus LASR eliminates traditional barriers to working with blockchain and smart contracts, creating a welcoming space for developers from various backgrounds. On this page, you'll find a summary of steps to create a LASR application.

## Step 1: Choose Your Language

While the LASR project currently only supports Typescript, additional language support will be added soon. If you're interested in helping LASR grow, get in touch through the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/versatus).

Pick a programming language you're comfortable with and create dApps on your local machine.

## Step 2: Develop Your Program

Start by developing your application locally, using familiar tools and workflows. The LASR system processes JSON input and output, simplifying debugging and making it easier to understand and troubleshoot your application's operations.

### Using an Existing LASR Program

If you want to use an existing LASR program, you can quickly get started by calling it on the LASR network. The LASR system retrieves the program from the IPFS. Once the program is retrieved, the LASR network sets it on the EigenDA and then processes and executes it. As a result of this process, you receive the results in your machine, completing the utilization cycle of the program within the LASR network.

## Step 3: Deploy to IPFS

Once your program is ready, deploy it to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is a decentralized file system that uses peer-to-peer protocols for content-addressed data sharing, ensuring secure and efficient data distribution.

For further insights on IPFS, you can explore [its documentation](https://docs.ipfs.tech/).

## Step 4: Register Your Program on the LASR Network

After deployment, register your LASR program within the LASR network. This network is a blockchain implementation based on Ethereum, utilizing a Layer 2 solution to improve scalability and minimize transaction expenses.

LASR uses EigenDA for settlement, which in turn settles to Ethereum. Therefore, transactions are not directly settled on Ethereum but through EigenDA, enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

## Step 5: Execution and Utilization

Once registered, your program becomes part of the LASR network. The LASR system retrieves the program from IPFS, processes it, and executes it. Transactions are settled on EigenDA, and you receive the results on your machine. This process ensures a seamless cycle of development, deployment, and execution within the LASR network, providing a robust and scalable environment for your applications.

By following these steps, developers can create, deploy, and utilize LASR applications efficiently, leveraging the robust infrastructure and scalable environment provided by Versatus LASR.
