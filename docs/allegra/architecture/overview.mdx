# Allegra's Architecture

Allegra's technical architecture integrates blockchain technology, distributed systems, and traditional cloud infrastructure to provide a decentralized, resilient, and scalable cloud computing platform. This section explores each component of the architecture and how they interact to create a robust system.

At its core, Allegra employs a layered architecture where each layer plays a critical role in the overall functioning of the platform. This layered approach maximizes the strengths of different technologies and allows for efficient, scalable, and transparent operations. The diagram below provides a visualization of this architecture.

## Key Layers of the Allegra Architecture

Each layer is crucial in delivering a powerful, decentralized cloud computing solution. For a deeper understanding of how each layer functions and contributes to Allegra's overall architecture, explore the specific sections linked below.

- [Network Layer: The Front Lines](/allegra/network_layer): This layer handles all incoming requests and efficiently directs traffic across Allegra's distributed infrastructure, ensuring optimal load balancing and fault tolerance.
- [Allegra Core: The Heart of the System](/allegra/allegra_core): The core layer manages the decentralized cloud infrastructure, handling resource allocation, consensus, and communication between different nodes. It includes key components like RAGER and the Quorum Manager.
- [Virtualization and Storage: The Workhorses ](/allegra/virtualization_storage): This layer is responsible for the actual computation and data storage. It supports multiple virtualization technologies and ensures data redundancy and fast access through a distributed storage system.
- [EigenLayer and Ethereum: The Foundation](/allegra/eigenLayer_ethereum): At the base of the architecture, EigenLayer and Ethereum provide the foundational security and settlement layers. They support restaking capabilities and proofs of instance liveness, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of the platform.
