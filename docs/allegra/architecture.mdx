# Allegra Architecture

Allegra's architecture ensures that developers can focus on building innovative dApps without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. The decentralized nature of Allegra provides robust security, transparency, and cost-efficiency for deploying, managing, and scaling decentralized applications (dApps). Here's an in-depth look at each component and how they work together:

### Detailed Flow

The steps below describe in details the architecture's diagram above:

1. **Developer uses CLI**: The developer uses the CLI to provision a VPS, add authentication, retrieve SSH details, expose services, and manage instances.

2. **CLI communicates with RPC Client**: The CLI sends commands to the RPC Client, which in turn communicates with the Allegra protocol.

3. **Allegra Protocol coordinates tasks**: The protocol handles state synchronization, resource allocation, fault recovery, load balancing, and auto-scaling.

4. **Resource Discovery identifies resources**: The protocol discovers resources across the network to allocate them efficiently.

5. **Resource Owning Quorum maintains resources**: The quorum of nodes owns and maintains the resources, ensuring they function correctly.

6. **Responding Node handles user requests**: Nodes receive and route user requests to the appropriate quorums, responding back to users.

7. **Developer VPS runs the dApp**: The VPS instance, provisioned by the developer, runs the dApp and is maintained by the quorum.

### Allegra Architecture Components

The table below presents all components involved in Allegra:

| **Component**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Developer**              | The developer initiates the process using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to provision a Virtual Private Server (VPS). They can add authentication, retrieve SSH details, expose services to the public, and manage their instances. |
| **CLI (Command Line Interface)** | The CLI is the primary tool used by developers to interact with the Allegra protocol. Through the CLI, developers can issue commands and manage their VPS instances.                                                |
| **RPC Client**             | The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Client is used by the CLI to communicate with the Allegra protocol. It acts as an intermediary, sending commands and receiving responses from the protocol.                           |
| **Allegra Protocol**       | The core protocol of Allegra coordinates essential tasks such as state synchronization, resource allocation, fault recovery, load balancing, and auto-scaling. It ensures the seamless operation of the decentralized infrastructure.        |
| **Resource Discovery**     | Resource discovery within the Allegra protocol identifies available resources across the network. This process ensures that resources are efficiently allocated to different instances.                                    |
| **Resource Owning Quorum** | A quorum of nodes is responsible for owning and maintaining the resources. They ensure the proper functioning of the instances and maintain the state according to the protocolâ€™s requirements.                              |
| **Responding Node**        | Nodes that receive requests from users. They route these requests to the appropriate quorums and ensure responses are sent back to the users.                                                                               |
| **Developer VPS**          | The virtual private server instance provisioned by the developer. This is where the dApp runs and is maintained by the responsible quorum of nodes.                                                                         |
| **Session**                | Represents the ongoing interaction between the developer and their VPS instance. The session includes all activities from provisioning to managing the instance.                                                            |
