**Allegra** simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of decentralized applications (dApps) by leveraging a decentralized network of nodes. This page provides an overview of how Allegra works.

## The Lifecycle of a Request

Allegra's architecture and layered approach streamline the deployment, management, and scaling of dApps. From launching a new instance to managing user requests and ensuring data consistency, each step in the lifecycle of a request is designed for optimal performance, transparency, and decentralization. This step process is described below: 

1. The developer sends a request to create a new VPS.
2. The request is routed through the Network Layer to the Allegra Core.
3. The Core uses RAGER to determine the best location for the new VPS.
4. The Quorum Manager ensures that the decision is agreed upon by the network.
5. The VM & Container Manager creates the new VM or container.
6. The Storage Layer initializes the necessary storage for the instance.
7. The Network Layer configures the networking for the new instance.
8. The Core sends a response back to the developer with the details of the new VPS.

## Next Steps

Allegra's architecture ensures that developers can focus on building innovative dApps without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. The decentralized nature of Allegra provides robust security, transparency, and cost-efficiency.
