# <span><ProblemIcon/></span> The Current Challenges in Cloud Computing

The current cloud computing landscape is dominated by a few major providers, which has led to several critical challenges that threaten the future of digital innovation and freedom. Understanding these issues is essential for making informed decisions about your cloud infrastructure.

<ProblemSolutionCard icon={{type: 'problem', number: 1}}>
## Centralization of Control
The concentration of cloud services in the hands of a few major providers has resulted in an alarming centralization of digital power. This monopolistic control raises serious concerns about censorship, data privacy, and the presence of single points of failure that could disrupt global digital infrastructure.

<ProblemSolutionCard icon={{type: 'problem', number: 2}}>
## Lack of Transparency
Traditional cloud platforms operate with limited transparency, , requiring you to place significant trust in service providers without full visibility into how your data and resources are managed. This opacity can compromise security and make it challenging to optimize your cloud usage.

<ProblemSolutionCard icon={{type: 'problem', number: 3}}>
## Scalability and Cost Inefficiencies
As your business or application grows, you may face unpredictable costs and scalability issues. The current cloud computing models can lead to billing nightmares and inefficient resource allocation, particularly affecting startups and smaller players trying to scale sustainably.

## Vulnerability to Censorship and Control
Centralized cloud providers are susceptible to service interruptions due to regulatory pressures, geopolitical issues, or corporate decisions. These vulnerabilities pose significant risks to the continuity and independence of your digital services.

<ProblemSolutionCard icon={{type: 'problem', number: 5}}>
## Limited Sovereignty and Ownership
Using traditional cloud services often means giving up a degree of ownership and control over your data and computing resources. In an era where data holds immense value, maintaining digital sovereignty becomes increasingly important for protecting your interests and those of your users.
</ProblemSolutionCard>

<ProblemSolutionCard icon={{type: 'problem', number: 6}}>
## Risk of Catastrophic Outages
Recent incidents have highlighted how centralized cloud infrastructures can suffer major outages, leading to widespread disruptions, grounding international airlines, disabling emergency services, and halting businesses for days. Such failures underscore the need for a more resilient and decentralized approach to ensure the reliability of your cloud computing services.
