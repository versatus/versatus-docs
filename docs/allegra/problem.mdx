# The Current Challenges in Cloud Computing

The current cloud computing landscape is dominated by a few major providers, which has led to several critical challenges that threaten the future of digital innovation and freedom. This page presents the issues presented by the current landscape.

## Centralization of Control

The concentration of cloud services in the hands of a few major providers has resulted in an alarming centralization of digital power. This monopolistic control raises serious concerns about censorship, data privacy, and the presence of single points of failure that could disrupt global digital infrastructure.

## Lack of Transparency

Traditional cloud platforms operate as opaque systems, requiring users to place blind trust in service providers. This lack of transparency compromises security and limits users' ability to fully understand and optimize their cloud resources.

## Scalability and Cost Inefficiencies

As businesses and applications grow, they often face unpredictable costs and scalability challenges. The current model of cloud computing can lead to billing nightmares and inefficient resource allocation, particularly for smaller players and startups.

## Vulnerability to Censorship and Control

Centralized cloud providers are susceptible to service interruptions due to regulatory pressures, geopolitical issues, or corporate decisions. This vulnerability poses a significant threat to the continuity and independence of digital services worldwide.

## Limited Sovereignty and Ownership

Users of traditional cloud services often sacrifice true ownership and control over their data and computing resources. This loss of digital sovereignty is increasingly untenable in an era where data is as valuable as currency.

## Catastrophic Outages and Single Points of Failure

Recent incidents have starkly illustrated the fragility of centralized cloud infrastructure. Major outages have caused global disruptions, grounding international airlines, disabling emergency services, and halting businesses for days. These widespread failures underscore the critical need for a more resilient, decentralized approach to cloud computing.

## The Solution

The solution to these various problems is addressed by Allegra. By offering a new way to build, and interact with cloud infrastructure. Refer to the [Allegra Solution](/allegra/solution) page to learn how Allegra solve this challenges.
