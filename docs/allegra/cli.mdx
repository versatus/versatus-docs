The Allegra CLI (Command Line Interface) provides developers with a toolset to interact with Allegra, allowing for seamless management and deployment of Virtual Private Servers (VPS), containers, and other cloud resources in a decentralized environment. With a few simple commands, you can create, start, stop, and delete instances, ensuring that your dApps remain operational, scalable, and efficient.

## Creating a New Instance

The Allegra CLI interacts with the `VmManager` component, which handles the creation process. Use the following example command to create a new Ubuntu 22.04 instance named "my-instance" with 2GB of RAM and 4 CPUs:

```sh
allegra create --name my-instance \
  --distro ubuntu \
  --version 22.04 \
  --ram 2048 \
  --vcpus 4 \
  --sk <my-secret-key>
```

- `--name`: Specifies the name of the VPS instance.
- `--distro`: Sets the operating system distribution for the instance.
- `--version`: Specifies the version of the chosen operating system distribution.
- `--ram`: Allocates the amount of RAM (memory) to the instance, specified in megabytes (MB).
- `--vcpus`: Allocates the number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs) for the instance.
- `--sk`: Provides the secret key for authentication with the Allegra platform.

## Starting an Instance

To start an existing instance, use the `allegra start` command. This command initiates the process to start the instance, making it active and ready for use.

```sh
allegra start --name my-instance --sk <my-secret-key>
```

- `--name`: Specifies the name of the VPS instance to start.
- `--sk`: Provides the secret key for authentication with the Allegra platform.

## Stopping an Instance

To stop a running instance, use the `allegra stop` command. This command halts the instance, pausing all activities until it is restarted.

```sh
allegra stop --name my-instance --sk <my-secret-key>
```

- `--name`: Specifies the name of the VPS instance to stop.
- `--sk`: Provides the secret key for authentication with the Allegra platform.

## Deleting an Instance

To delete an instance, use the `allegra delete` command. This command removes the specified instance from the Allegra network, freeing up resources and ensuring no further charges.

```sh
allegra delete --name my-instance --sk <my-secret-key>
```

- `--name`: Specifies the name of the VPS instance to delete.
- `--sk`: Provides the secret key for authentication with the Allegra platform.
